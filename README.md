# Here are some internal readings (~1-3 hours)

- Check your **Gmail inbox** and **Google Calendar**. You already have a lot of emails and calendar invites. You can take a look at [previous team@ email communication](https://groups.google.com/a/flatironschool.com/forum/#!forum/team) that isn't in your inbox as well. I recommend skimming through the past ~1-2 month's worth of emails in case there is anything important.

- Check out the most recent [team meeting presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qLDDGAOWJO4JHro3TAEDKHLBNrbctnmfI6QdGsrCMcA/edit#slide=id.p). You can also read more about the [weekly roundups](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=44793976) that we host every Friday from 12pm-1pm.

- Every week, we produce a **Flatiron Weekly Internal Newsletter (FWIN).** The FWIN is a weekly email that goes out to the whole company with updates on what's been going on. You should read the [most recent ~1-2 months of FWINs](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewrecentblogposts.action?key=OP) to get a better sense of what's been going on. Going forward, you can contribute to the FWIN by emailing your updates to Adam Enbar before Sunday night.

- Our **[wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/dashboard.action)** as a whole has a wealth of information. First, read up on [how to use the wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OP/How+to+Use+the+Wiki). In particular, you should check out the [HR space](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Employee+Resources), our updated [Values](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Company+Values), our [Code of Conduct](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Code+of+Conduct), our [Voice and Tone Guidelines](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/MAR/Voice+and+Tone+Guidelines) and [Goal Setting & Performance Management](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45580917).
  - Please also contribute to the Employee Resources space this week! Your experience as a new hire will be valuable in informing the content that future new hires will see.

- **Get inspired!** Read more about how Flatiron School is changing lives on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/search?q=flatiron+school) (specifically see "Reviews of: Flatiron School" to read about the experience of our immersive students). There is also a [motivation wall](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PC/Motivation+Wall) in the Pre-College space on our wiki where we've shared some kind words sent in by our partners and customers. For even more motivation, watch the [videos](http://go.flatironschool.com/kode-with-karlie-winners) from the 2015 Kode with Karlie scholarship winners to hear why they want to learn how to code; also check out how our 2015 Code for Good scholarship winners want to [code for good](http://go.flatironschool.com/dosomething).
