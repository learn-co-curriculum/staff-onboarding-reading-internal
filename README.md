# Here are some internal readings (~1-3 hours)

- Check your **Gmail inbox** and **Google Calendar**. You already have a lot of emails and calendar invites. You can take a look at [previous team@ email communication](https://groups.google.com/a/flatironschool.com/forum/#!forum/team) that isn't in your inbox as well. I recommend skimming through the past ~1-2 month's worth of emails in case there is anything important.

- Every week, we produce a **Flatiron Weekly Internal Newsletter (FWIN).** The FWIN is a weekly email that goes out to the whole company with updates on what's been going on. You should read the [most recent ~1-2 months of FWINs](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewrecentblogposts.action?key=OP) to get a better sense of what's been going on. Going forward, you can contribute to the FWIN by emailing your updates to Adam Enbar before Sunday night.

- Our **[wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/dashboard.action)** as a whole has a wealth of information. In particular, you should check out the [Employee Resources space](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Employee+Resources+Home), our updated [Values](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/MEM/Values), our [Code of Conduct](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/MEM/Code+of+Conduct), and [Small Improvements (staff feedback process)](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OP/Staff+Feedback+Processes+-+Small+Improvements).
  - Please also contribute to the Employee Resources space this week! Your experience as a new hire will be valuable in informing the content that future new hires will see.
