# Here are some internal readings (~1-3 hours)

- You can read more about the [weekly roundups](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=44793976) that we host every Tuesday from 5-6pm.


- Every week, we produce a **Flatiron Weekly Internal Newsletter (FWIN).** The FWIN is a weekly email that goes out to the whole company with updates on what's been going on. You should read the [most recent ~1-2 months of FWINs](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewrecentblogposts.action?key=OP) to get a better sense of what's been going on. Going forward, you can contribute to the FWIN by emailing your updates to Adam Enbar before Sunday night.


- Our **[wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/dashboard.action)** as a whole has a wealth of information. First, read up on [how to use the wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OP/How+to+Use+the+Wiki). In particular, you should check out the [HR space](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Employee+Resources), our updated [Values](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Company+Values), our [Code of Conduct](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Code+of+Conduct), our [Voice and Tone Guidelines](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/MAR/Voice+and+Tone+Guidelines) and [Goal Setting & Performance Management](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45580917).
